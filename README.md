sleep cycles, stress, and menstrual cycles. Bellabeat also offers month-to-month memberships that allows their users to fully personalize and track their nutrition, exercise,
sleep, health, beauty, and mindfulness.



## Current Project:
As part of our analysis, we will examine the usage patterns of non-Bellabeat smart devices and compare them to those of Bellabeat's products. Our goal is to answer the following questions:

### What are the prevailing trends in smart device usage?
### How can these trends be relevant to Bellabeat's customers?
### How can these trends inform and shape Bellabeat's marketing strategy?
