## Current Project:
For this current project we have been asked by Bellabeat’s cofounders Urška Sršen and Sando Mur, and Bellabeat’s marketing analytics team to gain better insights on how current
Bellabeat product consumers use their products and then provide insightful recommendations for continued growth and future marketing strategies.
